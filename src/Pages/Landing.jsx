        <div class="h3">Images that are in the public domain are sometimes considered to be “copyright-free.” Some content was created so long ago that it is no longer under copyright. Some artists donate their art to the public before the copyright would otherwise expire. And certain government agencies make their content available for all to use.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But it can be challenging to determine what’s in the public domain and what’s not. Even if the content is in the public domain, additional permissions may be required for commercial use.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Copyright duration has many variables depending on where the image was created, when and if it was ever registered, and permissions related to what the image shows. Government agencies may require photo credit.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The fact is, you’re rolling the dice anytime you use an image without a license from a reputable company.</div>
